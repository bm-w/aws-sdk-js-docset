# AWS SDK for Node.js DocSet (for Dash) generation script

By Bastiaan Marinus van de Weerd, November 2013 – January 2014.

_NB. Currently only includes a subset of the documentation sets._

Run `make build` or `make install PREFIX=path/to/docsets/folder`. When no `PREFIX` is specified, the DocSet will be installed into `~/Library/Application Support/Dash/DocSets`.
